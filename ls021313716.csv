Than in Dark is becoming totally different as the story goes along.The series tales place in Winden a little town in Germany. There are quiet characters to follows and you will be sucked in as well as addicted as I watched the series.The show opens with a voice-over explaining that ?everything is connected,? which turns out to be true of the relationships between the parents and children in four families that are introduced. There are a lot of characters to keep track and you must pay attention because if you blink you will miss something. We meet Jonas (Louis Hofmann), a teenager who has spent time in a mental hospital following his father?s suicide that is the beginning  scene , Jonas and several friends go on a late-night expedition into the woods to see if they can recover some drugs that Erik stashed away in a hiding spot, Erick is the one who disappeared at he beginning of the story. They get spooked by going to a cave where you should not go in some kind of nuclear underground stuff, in the process, a friend?s younger brother, Mikkel (Daan Lennard Liebrenz) disappears. The town may not know where Erik is, but we do. Erik is sitting in a chair like an electric chair and you will see someone briefly in the room. You will not know what is going on too much. Town goes searching for Mikkel and now there are two kids missing. He gets weirder from here on out, you will not believe where Mikkel winds up at, and that is all I am going say.
Dark is concerned about atmosphere and suspense with a cliff ending at the end of the series. The series setting is autumn, darkness, rain, and the smell of death is everywhere. It is going to become a chilling classic creepy thriller. Dark is stubble and as the horror element in it even a little bit of neon-noir in there. And yes I think Netflix has a hit on their hand.

The stories are purely fictional but of what is going on today. The second season however is that the agents on the field. Nadia who trained to be an agent is going to be in Iran to work in a company well that is her cover. The talented Sara Giraudeau assumes the role beautifully well here as wells the other actors Camille de Castelnau, Cécile Ducrocq, Hippolyte Girardot, Raphael Chevènement, Antonin Martin. The narrative intersect with intelligence, participating in the immersion in this new season which is proving exciting. These new episodes embrace, moreover, the actuality with a realism that will put a chill thought your back, taking as background the narratives evoking both the Syrian conflict and the Islamic radicalism. Mathieu Kassovitz and Jean-Pierre Darroussin recover their characters with greediness and engage in this duel of cat and the mouse game, the two actors seeming to savour their acting by bringing more nuances to  their characters that one might have thought immovable. Over all a terrific second season that went up a notch big time and yes there is a season 3. Season 3 will be the final chapter like a trilogies than Rochant I think is going to put new character for season 4 that will start a new chapter.",Le Bureau des Légendes,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/,tvSeries,8.7,52,2015,Drama,3768,2015-04-27,

But then he finds  his wife Kate (Emma Booth) . She died a few years back after a battle with breast cancer. It becomes apparent that these people are definitely something different. There some similarities between the two series which I am not going to get in because I do not want to give any away. The biggest drama comes from Hayes and his former wife Kate. After her death, James fell in love with Kate?s best friend Sarah (Emily Barclay), and they are expecting a child any moment. The thing is here this series will surprise you at every turn. Who are those people and why did they come back. Maybe the came back to finish some unfinished business. Some even say an act of god. James is trying to keep everything under control and contained but shit hits the fan at every turn. Not easy task to do when most of all he wants to protect his wife Sarah. Can they sent them back?

The series uses film noir ambience and rhythms to set itself apart from the usual action-oriented superhero adaptations which I like a good move there it put me right in the mood. The series takes place in Harlem it?s the steady drumbeat of visual and spoken references to Harlem?s history and culture. So you are going to love it or hate it depending on your taste.
Of course there is a corrupt politician?s self-serving development plan is called the New Harlem Renaissance. it is a comic-book adaptation about a reluctant hero taking on gangsters and crooked politicians. And our hero here is black and had impenetrable skin even bullet can?t hurt him. There's plenty to like about Luke Cage, including the gorgeous Harlem locations  and lively performances by musicians like Raphael Saadiq, Charles Bradley and Jidenna. Coker?s surrounded Colter with a stellar supporting cast, Ali and Woodard give extra dimension to their complex antagonists, and Simone Missick is a welcome discovery as Misty Knight, a detective who acts as both Luke?s love interest and foil. Frank Whaley who I love plays the partner of Knight and as always he shines here.

By documenting the early years of his reign, The Tudor is able to catch Henry who at 18 was in power. Everyone knows about the fat, bearded, dangerously misogynistic Henry, but in his youthful years he was not only more physically agile and sexually adventurous so they tell us here  but also a bit more forward thinking. Of course, a lot of events didn?t go his way, and his anger would soon rise to cause woe. The Tudors doesn?t shy away from telling the story. Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, became King Henry VII at age 28 after defeating Richard III and later marrying Elizabeth of York. His rise was complicated and bloody, but his reign led to peace, and he eventually started the transition to his oldest son, Prince Arthur. Nice costume as authentic has it is going to get.

Basically it is you typical series solving crime but it is done with humor on the light side. A show that all the family can watch. Adeline has a closet in her skeleton and Cherif is trying to warm up to her. The first season is just what the doctor ordered.

You have the mad doctor who does experiment on  patients, an interracial couple of which one of them ends up in the institution. Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), a shady journalist who is intent on exposing Briarcliff?s manifold abuses but something happens to her. To add it all off in the mix they add some strange characters from the institution who are the patient there for years. Plus a serial killer on the loose.

I saw a documentary of Pablo Escobar and they stuck with the documentary. Wagner Moura is great at playing Escobar even looks like him. I think he incarnated Pablo perfectly well to a T I should say. The series was shot in Colombia. It does not glamorize the drugs dealer?s life style or anything like that instead you get on one side the drug dealer with Escobar and the other side the investigation with a team of DEA trying to close in on Escobar. There is a narration thought the series of the DEA agent who is after Escobar. It is the story on how cocaine got into the US and all over that world, and it is unbelievable how much cocaine Escobar was producing and getting into the street of the US. They got smarter and smarter on how to smuggling it in the country not counting how much there were bribing police officers, government official and if there were not on his side week you know the story. When there is drugs there is violence a known fact here, Pablo left a body count behind him around 100 or so people. Pablo was on the top 7 list of Forbes back then of one of the most richest man in the world.

He arrived and seek a duel with one of the Musketeers saying it is him who killed my father. They claim that they are not responsible. In the mix you have the ?evil?

The first season is streaming on Netflix in Europe now and this series is a little jewel. The British knows how to make those period piece very well here. Most episodes revolve around a scheme either plotted by or against the  ruthless Cardinal Richelieu. Watching the Cardinal and his Red Guards constantly get one upped by the Musketeers you never get tired of it. to top it all you will have stories that deal with betrayal, slavery, women?s rights, infidelity, oppression, and honour. And that is just the first season that has 10 episodes. Of course it has a classic feel to it.

Well, he can die, and fell the pain, but he keeps coming back to life, in the water nude.  A gift that he acquired after a heroic act two centuries ago (which we see in the premiere) and no longer wants. He decided to see what cause this curse so he can put his life to an end or can be immortal. Henry is a medical examiner in  New York, a job he took so that he could study death and try to figure out what happened to him.
Here is a series that does crime but a different way and a la Sherlock. Now you might say how many time are they going to manipulate that. You see in the 70?s there were a lot od cop shows. Then in the 80? yes cop shows but with a bit a reality in it. And for a while cop shows as wide and got resurrected because of CSI. They combined forensic and police work together. Very soon that is going to get old. So what is next then. Well you know Marvel comic series. The show does have a spark when Henry and a detective named Jo Martinez (Alana De La Garza) interact. Both have lost loves in their past, and Jo senses there?s something different about Henry. So she is trying to figure it out but there is obstacles. Now that they are sidekick provides a nice touch for the series. Judd Hirsh is with him and the only one who knows is secret you will see who is he to Henry when you watch the story.

Brennan is the central character and team leader of the fictional Jeffersonian Institute Medico-Legal Lab an institution that collaborate with the FBI, it is based on the real-life relationship between the FBI and the Smithsonian Institution. Set in Washington, D.C., the show revolves around solving Federal legal cases by examining the human remains of  murder victims. Dr. Brennan and her team provide scientific expertise and Special Agent Booth provides FBI criminal investigation technique.
?I don?t know what that means.? Brennan in nearly every episode, in response to any one of a hundred pop culture references. Twenty  years ago the audience had no clue what a forensic science was CSI has changed that now a bunch of series has come out with the same idea manipulate differently. This isn?t your father?s forensic detective show. This one is done with humour and heart. Based on the books of Kathy Reichs, Bones is the lovely but socially lacking Dr. Temperance Brennan. Each week Booth delivers a new set of bones for Bones to examine, after all that?s why they call her bones. The crime scene is gruesome full of bugs, rotting flesh, and detailed murder descriptions. In order to keep the show into dark mode the put humour to it, so like that they target the majority of the audience. The two characters are well-balanced with each other: their approach to life, to their work, to the pursuit of the next case. They have their share of arguments and disagreement plus they have a good sense of humour and work well with each other. They have a bunch of other forensic comrades to help them out.

The Fall establishes a frightening, grimy and compellingly realistic scenario right from the beginning; after 2 women was found raped and murdered in their apartment, their bodies left in  posed tableaux, the Belfast police department reaches out to the  London-based Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Anderson) to help them out, to see of the murders are connected. Her supervisor on the cases, police captain Jim Burns (John Lynch), thinks that the most recent killing is possible that is related to the ex-fiancée. Gibson concludes that both murders were by the hands of the same person , and that the entire department needs to act quickly to prevent another tragedy from occurring.
What I like about this you see the murderer doing his thing and his everyday life. Than you see the detective at work and doing their thing. It is more realistic this way instead of closing the case in an hour show. You actually see how they investigate and the clues that lead to the killer. it is the cat and mouse game. The writer has done a nice job here. It has some unexpected turns here and there. Stella is a tough emotionless detective and has to deal with the rough tough detectives and personnel she is assigned too. There is a sensuous and cold side of Stella as you see in the second episode where she hooked up with one of the detective. Then there is Danielle Ferrington (played by Niamh McGrady), a tough officer who reveals that she?s gay. It is a fresh series not like the American series as I called them the Hollywood machine that are a bit unrealistic and solve the murder in an hour. Thank god for a refreshing look at it.

The first season is especially good , Spartacus builds up a series of secrets, alliances, betrayals and ambitions that all come together at key moments in the series. There is plenty of gladiators who has this muscular bodies fighting which later are compensated by food, alcohol and sex. The story around Spartacus is the tragic early death of star Andy Whitfield, who was diagnosed with cancer during the first season. Since he couldn?t film a second season due to treatment, creator Stephen S. Knight went back to the story telling to give us Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, a prequel to the events of the first season and that was fine. But the death of the actor had to have a change of casting. A lot of people thought that this was going to be the end of the series. The second and third season never quite hit the same highs as the first season but it still stands out. This was the only way to go. We know already what happens to Spartacus anyway so they had to keep going but they were not sure if the audiences would accept the  cast change. Luckily it worked, and they were back in business.

Unfortunately the series stopped here because Andy Whitfield tragically found himself battling cancer and died and the producers had to reset the casting process. When Andy was batting cancer the producers decided to do the prequel of the family the Batiatus/Lucretia storyline. Than went on to make Spartacus: Blood and sand with a fairly new Casting. It is bloody with nudity and violent as hell well that the way it was back then. People were slave and taken by a family with a bunch of fighters and force to fight in the arena against an other family?s fighters to the death. The thing that I don?t like is too many slow-motion shot they should be a few than back to normal. Other than that it is fine the writing is great so is the action. Lucy Lawless, Craig Parker, and John Hannah is perfect casting there. Andy Whitfield is brilliant as Spartacus and he stand out with a fine performance. The fighting scene are superb no doubt. The story line is fluid and moves along just fine like you would expect no boring scenes there. See back then there were bisexual men and women as well as heterosexuals sex was done where ever even people were watching that is what it was back then.

Of course it is a fictional story and there is a lot of movies that comes out about this subject. It is interesting enough and if it goes into great rating Sci-fi channel will turn this Mini-series into a full-blown series. Of course murder is the subject go the story it seems not surprising there too much. Sick with it and it will pick up. it is kind of addictive. You will be hooked like the rest of us. The cast as follows: Dr. Juliet Bryce (Andrea Roth), who isn?t getting along too well with her daughter, Nora (Jacqueline Byers), a strong-willed individual deeply affected by the murder. Chief Astronomer Emily Vanderhaus (Tiffany Lonsdale), the elder sister of the victim; Chief Safety Officer Duke Vanderhaus (Ryan Robbins), Emily?s husband, who doesn?t like where the case is heading up; James Toback (P.J. Boudousque), a maintenance worker and love interest for Nora; and Harris Enzmann (Gil Bellows), the son of the man who headed up the Ascension mission, who is back on Earth. And you will see what is going on back to earth also. There are questions unanswered but I think they left it like that because it might turn up a full-blown series and it will be answer then. Not too bad for a mini-series I like this one.

Now Netflix took upon to do this series with the Weinstein company for a whopping $60 millions for the first season. I think at this rate it will have 2 season only. Look what happen with Rome the second season was $100 million I think that is going to happen with this series. It is the second most expensive series so far. you see the last season of game of thrones went for $90 million. The production is outstanding by far and the costumes are beautiful. the set who are in malaria stands out. Beautiful production well made. Newcomer Lorenzo Richelmy is not as charismatic but he will do just fine this is the first season after all. The rest of the cast is fine so far. The female cast is terrific. Joan Chen is great as Empress Chabi, Kublai Khan?s bloodthirsty wife. The cinematography is fantastic with some great shots of china. The writing how ever should be polish a bit to make Marco Polo more interesting do not get me wrong it is still a great series. A lot of people are comparing Game of Thrones to Marco Polo but i am not going to do that. Marco Polo stands on its own on the top of that there is a cliff-hanger at the end of the season.

Emma is so focused on finding a mate for Harriet that she forget that she is not considered her own happiness.

No one not even the war veteran even talk about the war ever. For the first time a director from Germany has had this bold idea to do a mini series about it. People has talked about the series still six month after it came out. The young one started to ask question to they elders about the war and they answered. You see the German has swept the war under the rug, and like one superior said to Friedhelm it is a different kind of war. They had no idea what was going on. When they find out some of them didn?t think it was right to kill the Jews. Like Friedhelm and Wilhelm said this war does not make sense. To make matter worst Hitler promised a victory soon. Yeah! right. The story does not excuse what the German did during the war. It is compared with band of brothers of course it does not surprise me.

He was a drunks man who loves to party and wound up with different women every night. he came from a rich family his father was a banker but he didn?t want to pursue the same life as his father. He was serving in the English military during war time. Fleming was great with women was a collector and spoke German and French fluently. He became an naval  intelligence officer this was his most productive period at the time. Fleming was closely like  Bond: Cocky, flippant, and ever so  cool. His very tolerant superior Admiral John Godfrey (coy Samuel West) and Godfrey?s assistant Second Officer Monday (Anna Chancellor) are Fleming?s versions of ?M? and ?Miss Moneypenny?. The filmmakers, clearly pushed these real-to-life closer to the fictionalized characters they inspired. So it is not boring for the audience. Fleming had an overpowering mother, Evelyn ( Lesley Manville) is like the Bond villain here. Manipulating events and relationships for the ?benefit? of her son. A strong indicator to why Fleming would see to make Bond an orphan, clearly hating his mother and being almost powerless to stop her influence. Ian Fleming was best when he thought of creating solutions for other people. Fleming has a Bond very light  life, but for getting the audience interested and glue to their screen they spiced it up a bit.",Fleming,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647420/,tvMiniSeries,7.3,44,2014,"Biography, Drama, Romance",4291,2014-01-29,

Selfridge wanted a luxury store that sells great quality product from all over the world. The production with the costume and design interior of the house and the store is outstanding.

From the 1st episode I think they producers were not shy to include the sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to go on for centuries, even when they are no longer together. It is that love, passion that comes alive plus the sparks flies. The scenery are breath-taking so is the cinematography of course.

It is not you typical Hollywood blockbuster series thank God for that. There is only 3 episodes but I think there is 4 new ones that is coming out soon but I am not sure yet. You see those are women who are determined to find the killer, they play ordinary women, everyday women from back in the day with their own set of fear.

Turk has a girlfriend , the smart, slightly jaded nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). For J.D., settling in takes a bit longer. Even the janitor (Neil Flynn) seems to be persecuting him.

Nucky is the type of guy that would prefer to resolve problem by talking business instead of violence, and does not like to get his hands dirty. Jimmy told Nucky you can?t go just on foot in the world of gangsters you have to put both feet in. Also it is the start of some gangster?s career like Al Capone and lucky Luciano when they were young. Great choice to put Steve Buscemi  in the series as Nucky he fits the Part perfectly well.

SG1 learns that there is an highly intelligent humans like called Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier.
Here is a great Sci-Fi series that s intelligent and imaginative from the film Stargate. Only the top leadership of the United States, Russia, Great Britian, China and Germany are aware of the existence of the Stargate or the routine offworld missions that the US Air Force performs. The thing is that they have the military in charge of Stargate at the area 52 obviously not at area 51 (It is already taken as we know).  The mission of the Stargate Command is to explore the universe, establish diplomatic relationships with alien cultures, and acquire technology capable of defending earth. Of course you have powerful alien like the Goa?uld who are the super villains they are a threat to earth and the other gallaxy. The show was well written and well made although It took about $2 millions dollars an episode toward the end of the series. It was shot in Vancouver. It has a huge fan base.

Ross Martin, a 45-year old with impeccable credentials over a twenty-year career. He had begun acting on radio in the forties, playing a wide variety of characters, and his role as Gordon gave him a similar opportunity, as a master of disguise. Martin and ?Gordon? had much in common, and he and Conrad quickly developed a friendship that would continue until his death, in 1981. The loyalty between the pair was so strong, in fact, that when Martin suffered a mild heart attack, during the series? run, the star and producers refused to write his character out of the show, but filled his ?position? with ?guest stars?, until he was healthy enough to resume the role. The principle theme of the show was that a bad guy wanted to destroy the world and those two agent had to stop him with gadget and such which I loved.

The transition from being a well respected gangster to a normal citizen in Norway is not easy. Frank soon discovers that in order to succeed in Norway , he must resort to his old ways.
Here is a genius approach to a series where culture difference is going to clash. On the top of it is a gangster from America who settle in Norway. This series is from Netflix their first series and well done at that. This could of been the Soprano?s spin off but it is not. There is some stuff a lit bit out of hand  Frank being from New York can?t speak their language but understanding really fast learning there, but it is a TV show nobody is going to care. Right from the start you should know that Frank is going to resort to the old ways in order to succeed in Norway. There is a romance with the school teacher with light comedy in it. I love it myself? it is entertaining.",Lilyhammer,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1958961/,tvSeries,8.0,45,2012,"Comedy, Crime, Drama",23267,2012-01-25,

Luther (Idris Elba) is a Detective Inspector in a Special Crimes Unit who has just returned to work after having recently recovered from a mental breakdown due to pressures of a marriage break up and over commitment to his job. He is this great detective who solve crime in a unorthodox way. There is also the relationship with his ex-wife that he is not willing to understand that she wants to move on. I do not want to say too much to fear that you didn't see the series yet. Idris Elba who was in the series the wire is doing an excellent acting job in this one also. One of the more interesting back stories is the role of Alice Morgan, a psychopath who is a murderer  (played brilliantly by Ruth Wilson) who gives Luther chilling insight into the minds of his suspects . She is attracted to John and want to draw him into his passion even more.  John is seeing this and he is resisting it, it leaves the audience on edge. I recommend this series I have it in my collection and it is addictive and it will leave you wanting more.",Luther,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1474684/,tvSeries,8.5,60,2010,"Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller",102438,2010-05-04,

Colonel Klink is more concerned with having everything run smoothly and avoiding any trouble with his superiors. He doesn?t want to be reassign in the front line So he tries to be tough on Hogan and his crew.
It is not so far fetch but they made it in a comedy. During war time they were Americans who tried to free POWs some of them succeeded some did not however they saved lives. Here they made it in a sitcom that the majority  of the audience loved. It was a little ridiculous but fun to watch. It is life between American POWs and their German guards, constantly trying to put one over on each other. it was copied from the movie Stalag 13, which the series got saw by the major studio who released the movie. I got introduced to the series by a friends of mine back in the  late 70?s when I was in the U.S. back then and I thought it was a little absurd but I liked it. if you have not seen it yet do so you might like it.

Stacy (Jaimie Murray) uses her charms when it is needed. And then there is Danny (Marc Warren) who Mickey takes under his wing to who him the ropes.
Here is a series that is copied by the American as leverage but a little differently done. The British series however is the better one, it is well casted and well written. If I remember correctly there is only 6 episodes a season. When I first saw it I said to myself here is a great show about con artists. I loved the cons and the way they were going to con their victims.

The chemistry between the actors is fantastic and has done an outstanding job at that. Norma (Vera Farminga) is as twisted and manipulative as they come she has done an outstanding job.

Based on the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel and taking place in a near-future in the states a society overtaken by religious extremism where women who are fertile are used as pregnancy surrogate like sex-slaves for the largely sterile commanders of the new world order.
This series that I have found on OCS in France is worth watching for. The Handmaid?s Tale, based on the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel, is a cautionary tale, a story of resistance and a work of great story telling. This new religious extremist here are not fooling around as you see the handmaid who waits for the other handmaid at the same time everyday to go shopping for the commander keep in mind that they are dressed like the 1600?s, they travel in pair for safety purposes even they are guard at the gates of the commander?s house. You will see people hanging in the street I guessed those who did not obey or those who rebelled. They are offered an other name. as you see in the flashback little by little you will see June (Elisabeth Moss) that her husband and her kid has been killed and they took her to train her as a handmaid. It is a captive story and shocking at times, they have a ruthless dictator. they called themselves the Republic of Gilead they pray on fear and they praise motherhood, feminism but look out if you are gay well so long. As the story goes along you find out that some of them wants a way out. Plus other things will develop. The music fell terrifying and loud and make its point. The thing is people believe that the abnormal is normal.
